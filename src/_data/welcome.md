#### GNSI Launches Matching Donations Campaign for Education Accessibility Grants

&nbsp;

We were able to fund 23 small grants in the past two years through donations from two anonymous donors. Now weâ€™d like to find a way to continue the granting program into the future by developing a sustainable grant funding base.

&nbsp;

We are delighted to announce that Britt Griswold, long-time GNSI member and Distinguished Service Award recipient for his sustained dedication to our organization, has stepped forward to match any donations you make to the Guild now through December 31, 2021!! Your donations will go into a dedicated granting fund that will help members and non-members attend our Education events. Remember that as a 501(c)(3) organization, your donations to this fund are tax deductible in the USA.
